HUGE THANKS TO KrabCode for their LazyGui library for processing it does 70% of the work fr link below:

to any unfortune soul who downloaded this:

TO OPEN THE APP:
1)go into the directory called "BreadPaint"
2)go into windows-amd64
3)Click BreadPaint


you can press the "S" key to save the current image to the directory of the application. it will be titles "Latest_Image" or smthing i forgot. you can only save 1 at a time so I suggest whenever you save grab the photo from the program directory and paste it somewhere else then ull be fine.


dont touch the options and saves button in the tiny ui button it messes things up :3


have fun idk go crazy


idk if you can shade things..... feel free to find out
