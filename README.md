HUGE THANKS TO KrabCode for their LazyGui library for processing it does 70% of the work fr link below:

to any unfortune soul who downloaded this:

you can press the "S" key to save the current image to the directory of the script. it will be titles "Latest_Image" or smthing i forgot. you can only save 1 at a time so I suggest whenever you save grab the photo from the program directory and paste it somewhere else then ull be fine.


dont touch the options and saves button in the tiny ui button it messes things up :3 (unless you know what you are doing in which case go ahead the worlds your oyster)


have fun idk go crazy

you can use this wherever you want i dont really mind as long as like you dont sell it for money
